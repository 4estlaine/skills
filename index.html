            Your goal in each level is to reach the black goal block at the top of the screen by moving through a sequence of skill blocks.
            Skill blocks are color coded. Each color is is associated with a secret code comprised of the up, down, left, and right arrow keys.
            All skill blocks of the same color have the same code, constant across different levels.
            To pass through a skill block you must enter the code associated with the color of the block, in order.
            Different colored blocks can also have different length codes.
            Length of the code is indicated by the number printed in the center of the block.
        </p>
        <p>
            When you enter a skill block, a progress bar will appear showing your progress towards learning the skill. Every correct key guessed will fill
            up a portion of the progress bar. If an incorrect key is guessed, progress will be erased and you will have to start the sequence over.
        </p>
        <p>
            At the start of each level, you will have a choice of one or more paths leading to the goal.
            To begin, press the number key of the path you would like to take. If you make a mistake, you can press the space bar to backtrack.
        </p>
        <p>
            Each time you press a key within a skill block you will loose one unit of life. Completing a level will give you a life bonus.
            Try to get through all the levels before your total life runs out.
